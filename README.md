# Auth_user.py
Auth_usr.py
essentially this is just a simple raw socket 
connection attempt that tries to create a user and password 
setting user to uid 0. My goal is that if I am acting on the 
system level i can bypass aspects of the OS in user creation 
to escalate privileges without having to pivot to much.
I understand that unless there is a vulnerability this 
would likely never work however it is a project that i initially 
started as a script to run off of a USB and wanted
to try using sockets, ctypes, and other imports I had not used.
